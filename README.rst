JENKINS BUILDOUT FOR PLONE PROJECTS
===============================================================================

.. note::

  This buildout is currently work-in-progress. If you depend on this buildout
  please keep in mind that variable names or entire sections might change in 
  the future without announcement.

buildout.jenkins allows you to easiely set up a buildout that the Jenkins
CI-Server can use to generate reports for tests, test-coverage and 
code-analysis.

Dependencies
============

Make sure that setuptools are installed or you will get the error
``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'location'``.

Buildout
========

Create a jenkins.cfg that extends your existing buildout.cfg and set the 
package-name parameter for the package that you want to be tested::

  [buildout]
  extends =
      buildout.cfg
      https://raw.github.com/plone/buildout.jenkins/master/jenkins.cfg
      
  package-name = plone.app.discussion
  package-directory = src/plone.app.discussion

Jenkins Job Shell Build Script
==============================

Configure a free-style Jenkins project and add a shell build script with the
following lines::

  python2.6 bootstrap.py
  bin/buildout -c jenkins.cfg

If you want Jenkins to run the test only, append the following line::

  bin/jenkins-test

If you want Jenkins to run the test together with a test-coverage analysis
(suitable for use with the Cobertura Plugin in Jenkins), append::

  bin/jenkins-test-coverage

If you want Jenkins to run a code analysis, append::

  bin/jenkins-code-analysis

Jenkins Configuration
=====================

For Jenkins to be able to understand the output of the tests and analyses,
you will need to configure your instance accordingly.

* Test results with ``bin/jenkins-test`` and ``bin/jenkins-test-coverage``:
    Configure your Jenkins project's options by enabling `Publish JUnit test
    result report` and setting `Test report XMLs` to be
    ``parts/jenkins-test/testreports/*.xml``.

* Test coverage with ``bin/jenkins-test-coverage``:
    Install and configure the **Cobertura Plugin** following `the instructions
    <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin>`_, and
    configure your project's options such that you enable `Publish Cobertura
    Coverage Report` and set `Cobertura xml report pattern` to be
    ``parts/jenkins-test/coverage.xml``.

Plugins
=======

* Clonedigger - Setup of violations plugin:
    The final step, should be to bind the clonedigger's output with the
    Hudson. So, using the violations plugin, put the ``**/clonedigger.xml``
    string to the CPD field in the violations plugin setup. The clonedigger
    with ``--cpd-output`` will generate PMD's cpd similar output. (I hope
    there is no problem their XML schema in clonedigger).

    That should be all. Now run the build and watch for yourself! Enjoy.
